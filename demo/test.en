i would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously , and at the same time , from my position here in this chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people .
each and every one of us knows that any other region of europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .
for instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle ' s larvae , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives .
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .
the calculations are in decades rather than years .
in addition , i would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .
i am therefore very proud to say that the skilled austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .
we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank .
i was asked to highlight the result of the storms in ireland .
we had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .
we experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of e.coli-infected water .
i talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water .
natural habitats were destroyed .
so i ask that ireland be remembered in this particular case .
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force .
mr president , commissioner , i second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe .
for the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of europe , and i believe we need , in the long-term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future .
we certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way .
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
as has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe .
of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing , these storms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century .
i believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this chamber by a former fellow mep of ours , tom spencer . he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .
however , an exception should certainly be made in the case of shell and bp , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability .
we must be aware of this connection ; i do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course !
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
that concludes the debate .
the vote will be taken at noon on thursday .
food safety
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission .
mr president , i am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to parliament the main lines of the commission 's white paper on food safety , adopted on wednesday last , 12 january , in association with my colleague , mr liikanen .
at my hearing last september , i promised speedy delivery of this white paper .
i am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .
the white paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new commission was appointed last september .
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the commission 's green paper on food law was published .
equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge , as well as the bse crisis .
the white paper also reflects the concerns of this parliament which you have outlined to both president prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this house since the commission was appointed .
i do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in europe 's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months .
the commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .
when i launched the white paper last week i said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth .
the most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of europe .
if their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions .
this in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .
in an industry worth some eur 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects .
between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .
this crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and european level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety .
in saying all of this , i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .
the challenge is to make the system the very best .
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .
we are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .
we will also need the fullest support from the council and other key stakeholders .
the white paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation . all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .
the detailed action plan on food safety in the white paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .
over 80 measures are envisaged .
our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
we are also envisaging the establishment of a european food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
it has already attracted much comment , including reactions from members of parliament .
the chapter of the white paper devoted to the establishment of a european food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments . we are seeking views by the end of april on what we envisage .
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .
the commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .
why should a european food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
the first key concern is independence .
key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the bse crisis .
however , the commission believes that we must go further .
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .
they may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority 's establishment .
however , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough .
as the white paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .
within the authority i envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .
i am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .
to be proactive the white paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority .
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states .
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .
the commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .
we believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the commission , parliament and council .
i make no apology for this approach ; i firmly believe that it is the correct one .
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority .
i do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .
it was only last year that the treaty was amended to give parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter .
there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
i also reject this line of argument . how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
would this be in the interests of europe 's citizens ?
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .
i can assure you here today that the commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
i have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the member states .
this is a major task .
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the european union .
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science .
however , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre-eminent on the european stage .
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard .
as an integral part of a value-added structure , the white paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive .
the white paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .
this is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that member states and operators are complying with community legislation .
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
in this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in dublin .
this revised community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at community level , community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
as part of our proposals in this area - which i expect to bring forward at the end of this year - i will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the commission . these could include withholding community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a member state .
these proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the union .
in addition to the proposals for a new european food authority and an enhanced control system at community-level , the white paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the community 's legislation , covering all aspects of food products from farm to table .
it sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminants and residues , novel food , additives , flavourings , packaging and irradiation .
as regards the precautionary principle , i might add that the commission is currently finalising a communication which i expect to be adopted very soon .
i look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the members of parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .
however , having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees , i recognise that this was not feasible .
but i know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the white paper 's proposals on the authority .
we now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the commission 's ideas on the white paper on the establishment of a european food authority .
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate . parliament played a crucial role in europe 's response to the bse crisis .
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore .
i expect that parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .
while we have a number of months to the end of april to debate the issue and garner our views , i recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .
i would therefore ask parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
it is essential that the commission should have the benefit of parliament 's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the european union 's food safety regime .
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu 's food safety regime in the years ahead .
it is essential that we get the mix right .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .
i would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the european institutions , including the commission and parliament .
that is very much the right approach .
but there is one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight . i hope that we can thrash this out .
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
it is very important that we include liability in that process .
that is the one word i am talking about .
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
that cannot continue .
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .
mr president , it is a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .
you are unclear about this in your white paper .
what is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?
the final part of my question is as follows : when will bse testing be binding in all member states ?
that is another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your white paper .
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
i think the lines that you have set up regarding the food safety authority are a recognition of reality .
the member states would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .
however , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , i have to ask : if europe has the safest food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from brussels and under-implementation in the member states ? we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
regarding enlargement : what plans does the commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the white paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?
president , first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern , mrs roth-behrendt and mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper .
i find that encouraging and i look forward to further discussions with them and other members of parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .
mrs ahern raised the issue of liability .
that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .
once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
i have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration .
mrs roth-behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
at the moment the list is , as i say , a negative list and it is added to as required .
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .
this is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .
the work in relation to bse in member states and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in member states is ongoing , i know that mrs roth-behrendt has asked me this question before and i said i thought it was coming along quickly but i understand it is in inter-service consultation in the commission and work is currently under way .
i hope that the next time you ask me the question , i will be in a position to give you more detailed information .
mrs jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation .
i should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .
it is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that i have drawn to the attention of mr verheugen .
commissioner , the ignorance of certain member states has landed us in a major food crisis here in europe , and i am afraid that once more i have cause to be angry at the fact that again no members of the council are in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .
what i would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders .
of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but i would insist on parliament retaining the rights accorded it under maastricht and amsterdam , and even extending them .
i very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and i hope it does not come to that .
i also welcome the white paper .
but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and france 's refusal to lift the ban ?
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting .
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment ?
mr president , you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future eu food agency should not be located on the periphery , but you did not mention what that periphery was .
for example , the work of the eu unit located in dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .
it has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendations for improved food safety , and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers .
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union .
i would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?
in relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time .
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
you will notice in the white paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months .
i envisage that the board 's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september .
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september .
i do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work .
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice .
but it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .
mr florenz asks whether parliament will have a say in that .
that is an issue for consideration and discussion .
there may be a number of views on that .
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for parliament or members of parliament - or indeed parliament nominees - to be members of the board .
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if parliament , through nominees or even meps themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .
mr florenz also raised the question of anonymity .
i am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
it must be visible . it must be known .
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority .
the ceo of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority .
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous .
it must be visible .
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
mrs lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .
i suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in member states begin and end .
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level .
that is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .
but information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all member states and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .
over time , as i said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged .
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence .
it is something that is earned over a period of time .
however , the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the commission , parliament and council .
i realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the authority is - i believe - the way forward .
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .
in relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with community law pending a court ruling .
in relation to mrs lynne 's question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates to budget issues .
mrs myller then asked me about the location of the authority .
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .
i recognise that the feo is located in dublin and , although i come from that part of the world myself , i have to accept that it is not the centre of europe !
but the fvo is in quite a different situation from the food safety authority .
the fvo is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in dublin .
the food safety authority 's situation is quite different .
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation .
an important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise .
equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified .
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .
scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the commission and council are based .
that is my judgement at the moment .
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and i will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery .
colleagues , i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda .
i would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the conference of presidents .
if you feel that these sessions after a commission statement are important , i would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them .
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had 29 minutes of response by the commissioner , and his statement .
as you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
i hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the commission on such future occasions .
that concludes the debate .
question time ( commission )
the next item is question time ( b5-0003 / 2000 ) .
we will examine questions to the commission .
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to question time .
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session .
mr purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .
i object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for question time ; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and i do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .
that is the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda .
the fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
first part
question no 28 by ( h-0781 / 99 ) :
subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than 7 on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .
turkey 's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey 's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan .
what steps will the commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget ?
mr verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in akkuyu , turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .
according to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .
the commission acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting , construction , commissioning , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in turkey rests entirely with the turkish atomic energy authority .
the commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .
as commissioner wallström indicated during the hearings in the european parliament in september 1999 , the commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the turkish government in the future and i am happy to inform you that i will have a meeting with the turkish foreign minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue .
in particular , the commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .
according to information received from the international atomic agency , the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in june 1998 in adana .
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .
the commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material .
it acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency .
thank you for your reply .
i should like to make the following points : turkey is now a candidate country .
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
at the same time , it also wishes to acquire cadou type reactors from canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and india .
in this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology .
so much for the political aspect .
now to the technical aspect .
the safety factor in this type of project , and i am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
in cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .
however , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .
in this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .
therefore , and given that the relationship between the european union and the commission and turkey has now changed , it would be a good idea if turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of turkey within the european union .
a couple of weeks ago we had a debate in parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .
i have explained the position of the commission .
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable .
in the case of turkey it is different .
the plant is not yet there .
i have already said that turkey is part of the npt and of the convention on nuclear safety .
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with turkey .
if the conclusion is that turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal european safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with lithuania , slovakia and bulgaria .
mr president , the commissioner said that turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that turkey 's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the community , and would the commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with mr souladakis on this matter ?
i think it is the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .
i do not have these concerns .
i believe that turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in europe and i think it is quite right to discuss them here in parliament .
question no 29 by ( h-0786 / 99 ) :
subject : depleted uranium weapons has the commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon eu states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the kosovan conflict ?
if not , why not ?
mrs wallström has the floor on behalf of the commission .
thank you , mr bowe , for your question .
the european commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action .
as early as last june the commission financed a first study .
it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe .
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment .
the commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the united nations environment programme - balkan task force .
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net .
the balkan task force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .
no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the btf fact-finding mission .
however , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .
from a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern europe .
a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed . it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .
first of all , mr president , can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response .
clearly the commission has given some consideration to this problem and i am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
but i would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .
this uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .
this seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the gulf war .
i would therefore ask the commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within kosovo ?
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
thank you , mr bowe , for that question .
we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of kosovo .
but those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .
that is also mentioned in the report .
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia .
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .
a big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the european union .
it is important to follow up and it gives the member states , as well as the united nations and the commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment .
it also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
mr president , commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday .
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .
are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?
i wish i could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately i am not able to .
we make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .
that also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .
i wanted to ask the commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the nato armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?
i cannot answer that question .
when it comes to medical checks and so on , i do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .
what we know from the environmental side is what i have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check-ups i do not have the information about that .
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
question no 30 by ( h-0793 / 99 ) :
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile received over 4000 tibetans who escaped over the himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .
many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way .
the tibet intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the european union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by tibetans daily in tibet .
the tibet intergroup , therefore , gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in tibet and supporting the dalai lama ? s proposal for dialogue with the chinese government to resolve the situation in tibet , calls on the commission to appoint a special envoy for tibet to address the concerns of the european union and to help bring the tibetan and chinese authorities together for dialogue .
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet ?
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the concerns expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared .
i have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including tibet , firmly and candidly to the chinese authorities .
the european union did that at the european union ­ china summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on a number of human rights issues , including tibet .
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama .
i urge the chinese again to do so .
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities .
we are also doing a number of other things : in the european union-china human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assignment to tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for tibetans .
the appointment of an eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
but for my part , i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the tibetan community in exile .
i am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .
mr president , mr patten , of course , you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in china , and you are well aware of how hard the tibetans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hitherto .
however , if your response was to be that we should turn to " mr cfsp " , that is , to mr solana , then i fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter .
your approach , which i am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; i wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights .
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .
if we cut down here and say that the council now shares responsibility for this , then i fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the european commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the council .
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is .
i stated nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the council .
as it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the council makes the appointment .
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .
putting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .
i am very much hoping in the next few months that the commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out , among other things , that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in china or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the european union .
i have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world .
i repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet .
during the few months that i have been a commissioner that has happened twice , first of all in new york at our meeting with minister tang and most recently at the meeting in peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest .
if i can make a literary commendation to the honourable member , who i recognise is interested in these subjects , i recommend to him a book published just before christmas written by isabel hilton , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of tibet .
mr president , i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan greeting , which betokens peace and happiness .
we are not just talking about human rights and the environment where tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , serenity , compassion - as the dalai lama would say - to us europeans .
the question before us now is what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his holiness , the dalai lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the tibet affair ?
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people .
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural heritage and about the buddhist tradition .
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama .
it is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .
the commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .
i wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama .
at or around the time of president clinton 's visit to china , the president of the people 's republic of china gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .
it would be very beneficial , not just for tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the government of the people 's republic of china if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue .
question no 31 by ( h-0795 / 99 ) :
subject : commission 's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the eu according to newspaper reports , the commission has rejected the proposal by eu ombudsman jacob söderman for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the eu .
although the commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration , it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made , but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service .
are these reports accurate ?
what is the reason for the commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of eu administration ?
does the commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between parliament and the commission in september , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows parliament to express an opinion on it ?
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .
in november 1999 the commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its rules of procedure .
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
it should be noted that the new commission gave an immediate follow-up to the european ombudsman decision of 28 july 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code .
the commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the european ombudsman .
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the commission 's administration with the public .
it will be adopted through a legally-binding commission decision to be published in the official journal of the european communities .
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the european ombudsman 's office .
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself .
however , it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .
however , i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .
the newspaper reports were misleading .
i do not think there is any difference between us and the ombudsman .
there is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and i think we are soundly placed on that .
i want to repeat that honourable members , like the honourable member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
it is extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member .
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer .
for safety ' s sake , i should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of jacob söderman ' s proposal which the commission thinks is unacceptable .
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?
let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true !
" i would like to stress again that the commission has accepted all the ombudsman 's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 1999 " .
both documents , that is the commission 's document and the ombudsman 's draft , cover largely the same ground .
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the ombudsman on this important issue .
we will be happy to incorporate mr patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the members to bear in mind .
as the author is not present , question no 32 lapses .
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy . i am sorry .
according to the rules of procedure , you are not required to reply .
i wish you a good evening .
second part
questions to mr nielson , who is replaced by mr patten
questions 33 and 34 of questions to the commission were intended for mr nielson .
mr nielson cannot be present today since he is in south africa .
i must tell you that the vice-president of the commission , mrs loyola de palacio , has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that mr patten will reply to the questions .
question no 33 by ( h-0829 / 99 ) :
subject : ' mainstreaming ' in eu aid policy in 1995 the council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ( ' mainstreaming ' ) into the full range of eu aid policy .
the guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in ' gender mainstreaming ' but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the directorate-general for development .
' mainstreaming ' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy , strategy and measures .
to achieve that , the council 's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety .
current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-2 days ' training in such issues should form an essential part of the directorate-general for development 's introductory courses for new staff .
is the commission prepared to take such measures ?
can i first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , mr nielson , was that he could not be here but the honourable members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with south africa survives .
the commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so-called induction courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , i admit , on a regular basis .
the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .
we also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on .
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the directorate-general for development at all levels . it is not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add-on " .
this must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .
in addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .
equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals , action plans and strategies .
it would appear that we are in agreement about this .
however , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers .
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .
extremely few members of the directorate-general for development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .
only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .
that is naturally unacceptable .
what is the commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?
gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .
this limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .
as i point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .
my question is this : is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the directorate-general for development ?
well i certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson .
i must not go on about books , but i have just been reading the book by david landis barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back millennia .
secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the commission - it should be essential .
and , since it should be essential , i would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .
that goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority .
it is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .
thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground .
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said .
i hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .
since 1991 , the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia .
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme .
in 1998 and 1999 kyrgyzstan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan received technical assistance of eur 75 million .
this assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .
security considerations have prevented tajikistan from benefiting fully from tacis but a rehabilitation programme of eur 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .
in addition to national programmes , the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
food security programmes in central asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind .
these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , tajikistan .
funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
over the same period , kyrgyzstan received eur 17 million .
since 1993 the commission 's european community humanitarian office , echo , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .
in 1998 and 1999 eur 3.8 million was granted to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received over eur 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation .
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .

if you don 't mind my saying .
when i started this racket , us pugs were treated like dogs .
for 1 0 bucks , you got to tear somebody 's throat out .

i never had no management , that 's the trouble .
i got all this knowledge up here .
i want to give it to you .
i want to make sure all the shit that happened to me doesn 't happen to you .

tonight , we 're back down in the 20-degree range .
tomorrow , we may hit 40 .
it 's awfully chilly , so make sure you have it bundled up .
it stinks in here , you know ?
yeah , i know .

across the street .
place is like an animal morgue .
it 's a little cold , isn 't it ?
who killed all these things ?
are you crazy ? .
pay gazzo or end up on the hook .
- gazzo 's a good man .
- i know that .
talk to him about me and the collecting job .
get me out of this freezer .
you should keep this job because you eat better .
does it ever snow in here ?
you and my sister , how are you getting along together ?
- how you think ?
- i 'm not sure , rock .
what 's the story ?
about what ?
what 's the story ?
what 's happening ?
- sure i like her .
what 's the attraction ?
i don 't know .
fills gaps , i guess .
what 's gaps ?
she 's got gaps .
i got gaps .
together we fill gaps .
you balling her ?
don 't talk dirty about your sister .
are you screwing my sister ?
that 's why i can 't connect you with gazzo - because you talk too much .
- it 's cold .
i 'm going home .
- it is cold in here !
it stinks , and you stink .
you 're breaking the ribs .

you 're driving me crazy .
you 're sloppy because you 're off-balance .
take this string and tie it to both ankles .
- i never had good footwork .

marciano had the same problem , and this string cured it .
if you can move and you can hit without breaking the string , you got balance and become very dangerous .

he 's trying to help .
i get out of joint ' cause they take cheap shots .
paulie keeps asking me for a job , but he don 't know nothing about fighting .

i don 't know what he wants from me .
i don 't want nothing from you .

yeah .
it don 't matter 'cause i was nobody before .
- don 't say that .
- come on , adrian , it 's true .
i was nobody .
that don 't matter either , you know ?
' cause i was thinking , it really don 't matter if i lose this fight .
it don 't matter if this guy opens my head .
' cause all i want to do is go the distance .
nobody 's ever gone the distance with creed .
and if i can go that distance , see , and that bell rings and i 'm still standing ...
i 'm gonna know for the first time in my life that i weren 't just another bum from the neighbourhood .
